<h1 id="week-1">Week 1</h1><h2 id="what-is-cryptography-about">What is cryptography about</h2><h3 id="what-is-cryptography">What is cryptography</h3><p><em>Cryptography</em> is more than just encryption and decryption. Let's break it down a bit.</p>
<p>At its core, cryptography is about (a) secure key establishment and (b) secure communications.</p>
<p><em>Secure key establishment</em> amounts to Alice and bob agreeing on a shared key in such a way that an attacker has no idea what this key might be.</p>
<p><em>Secure communications</em> means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice and Bob know that they are talking to each other  </li>
<li>Their messages are confidential -- no one can snoop in on what they are saying.  </li>
<li>Their messages cannot be tampered with</li>
</ul>
<p>With the core out of the way, we can do some more interesting stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital signature: How can we make the equivalent of physical signatures in digital world while making sure an attacker cannot just copy and paste our signature elsewhere?</li>
<li>Anonymous communication: How can Alice interact with a server without the server knowying anything about who interacted with it?</li>
<li>Anonymous digital cash: How can we bring the anonymity of cash into the digital world while making sure people won't double spend?</li>
<li>Secure multi-party computation<ul>
<li>Consider the quote: "Anything that can be done with a trusted authority can also be done without"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crypto Magic!<ul>
<li>Privately outsourcing computation</li>
<li>Zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="history-of-cryptography">History of cryptography</h3><p>Book suggestion:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Code Breakers by David Kahn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some historical examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caesar Cipher: A fixed substitution that applies to all plain-text messages. So really, there wasn't really a "key"</li>
<li>Substitution Cipher: <ul>
<li>Using trial and error and a combination of single, double and triple letter frequencies, one can figure out what the key is.</li>
<li>Cipher-Text only attack =&gt; Given only the cipher-text, an attacker can figure out what the plain text was. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vigener cipher:<ul>
<li>This is the same thing as the repeating XOR cipher I encountered in cryptopals, except instead of XOR-ing, you add the letters of the key and plain-text together modulo 26.</li>
<li>Fortunately I have broken this before, so I was not phased by the bad explanation in the video.<ul>
<li>The key point to understand here is that we can break repeating-key encryption with key size <code>n</code> because every nth cipher text is encrypted with the same key. This means that we can split the cipher text into <code>n</code> parts and decrypt each part the same way you'd decrypt a Caesar cipher, then put all the keys back together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rotor Machines: Hebern, then the Enigma! <ul>
<li>The youtube channels <em>Computerphile</em> and <em>Numberphile</em> have great explanations of how these worked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Encryption Standard: The government was buying stuff from industry so they wanted to make sure industries were using good ciphers<ul>
<li>People at IBM came up with the original DES algorithm</li>
<li>These days DES is insecure and should not be used</li>
<li>Today, we have the "Advanced Encryption Standard"...lol what's next? the "Super Advanced Encryption Standard"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crash-course-in-discrete-probability">Crash course in discrete probability</h2><p>Cryptographic constructs are <em>always</em> accompanied by a proof of security</p>
<p>Discrete probability is used as the language of such proofs.</p>
<blockquote><p>The "discrete" part simply means that the number of possible things that can happen can be counted, it is not infinite.<br>
This is in contrast to <em>continuous probability</em> which is it's own beast that I hopefully will not be coming across in this course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The probability of something is <em>how likely it is for that something to occur</em><br>
That <em>something</em> is referred to as an <em>Event</em> and it is usually represented with a capital letter.</p>
<p>So, read P(A) as <em>the probability of event A</em></p>
<p>For any event E, the following is always true   <code>0 &lt;= P(E) &lt;= 1</code></p>
<p>The following applies only to <em>independent events</em> (will define later):</p>
<ul>
<li>If an event A occurs when either event B or C occur, the probability of event A occurring is the sum of the probabilities of event B and C occurring.</li>
<li>If an event A occurs only when event B and C occur, the probability of event A occurring is the product of the probabilities of event B and C occurring.</li>
</ul>
<p>A "Random Variable" can be thought of as a <em>variable</em> that holds the result of a <em>random experiment</em> or <em>process</em>.<br>
An example: Tossing a coin is a <em>random experiment</em>. So if I toss a coin and get HEADS, the result of that random process is HEADS. In the language of mathematics, this is equivalent to saying L = HEADS, where <em>L</em> is the random variable holding the result of the coin toss process.</p>
<p>Hmm events and random variables seem eerily similar. Yes they are. An event is actually a set of possible outcomes of a random variable!</p>
<p>Aaand, that's enough math for now. Back to fun.</p>
<h2 id="stream-ciphers">Stream Ciphers</h2><h3 id="information-theoretic-security-and-the-one-time-pad">Information theoretic security and the one-time pad</h3><p>So what is a <em>cipher</em>? A cipher is a set of two functions, encryption and decryption.<br>
Encryption takes a key and some message and produces cipher-text<br>
Decryption takes a key and cipher-text and produces a message</p>
<p>The encryption algorithm is often randomized (how is this possible?)
The decryption algorithm is always deterministic</p>
<p>What makes a <em>secure cipher</em> ?</p>
<p>The father of information Claude Shannon has our backs here thank God. Didn't realize I would be seeing his name in this corner of the world.</p>
<p>In plain English:<br>
"The cipher text should reveal no information about the plain text"</p>
<p>In the language of probability:<br>
For every pair of messages m0 and m1, the probability of encrypting m0 and getting a cipher text <em>c</em> should be the same as the probability of encrypting m1 and getting that same cipher text <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>A cipher that meets this requirement is said to have <em>perfect secrecy</em>. It leaks no information. It tells no tales.</p>
<ul>
<li>The One Time Pad (Vernam 1917)<ul>
<li>the key is a random bit string as long as the message</li>
<li>encryption is just XORing the key with the message.</li>
<li>decryption is just XORing the key and the cipher-text</li>
<li>Fast by not practical because you need to know the message length beforehand.</li>
<li>Given our above definition, the one-time pad has perfect secrecy.<ul>
<li>This is not the end of the story though. Perfect secrecy only guarantees that the cipher is not vulnerable to cipher text only attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Claude Shannon also proved (unfortunately) that a perfectly secure cipher must have keys that are at least as long as the messages.<br>
The one-time-pad satisfies this, but this certainly throws a wrench in things.</p>
<h3 id="stream-ciphers-and-pseudo-random-generators">Stream ciphers and pseudo random generators</h3><p>The stream cipher is an attempt to make a usable one-time-pad implementation.</p>
<p>It works like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key is some reasonable n-bit number</li>
<li>The encryption process takes that key and uses it as a seed for a Pseudo-random generator that produces a value as long as the message</li>
<li>That value is then used to encrypt the message.</li>
<li>The decryption process takes the key and uses it, yet again as a seed for the Pseudo-random generator. This would then produce the same value as long as the message, which we can use to decrypt the message</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems reasonable. The professor makes the point though that this stream cipher does not pass our <em>perfect secrecy</em> test. Which is technically true. The key is not the same size as the message.</p>
<p>However, intuitively, this does seem like it should work given that the PRG (pseudo-random generator) is not predictable.</p>
<p>So we need to do two things:
(a) Define what makes a PRG predictable vs unpredictable
(b) Come up with another metric for a cipher's security that would affirm intuition that a stream cipher could indeed work.</p>
<p>The answer to (a) was pretty straightforward. A PRG is predictable if given some number of bits <em>n</em> of the PRG's output, an attacker can predict what bit <em>n + 1</em> would be.</p>
<h3 id="attacks">Attacks</h3><ul>
<li>Two-time pad:<ul>
<li>The one-time pad has "one" in its name for good reason. An attacker who gets a hold of two messages that have been encrypted using the same one-time pad can recover both messages.</li>
<li>This answer is pretty convincing that it is possible:
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59/taking-advantage-of-one-time-pad-key-reuse">https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59/taking-advantage-of-one-time-pad-key-reuse</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just avoid related keys<ul>
<li>The example is WEP:<ul>
<li>The initialization vector was reset every 16 million frames or so, as well as every power-reset. This meant that there was a lot of opportunity for an attacker to observe two-time pads!</li>
<li>Worse, the PRG used did not do well when the keys were closely related (which they were, the IV was just being incremented). And there was an attack on it which allowed the attacker to retrieve the secret key after recording some number of messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cipher-text Integrity<ul>
<li>One problem with the one-time pad is that it does not guarantee integrity, which as we said, should be a core part of cryptography. An attacker could intercept the cipher-text, mess with it and send it along.</li>
<li>This could be especially bad when the attacker knows something about the content of the cipher-text (maybe they for sure know the format of the original message). They could easily inject or modify the message in a way that is confusing at best, harmful at worst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

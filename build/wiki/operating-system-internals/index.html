<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p>When we say a program is "running" we mean that a program is doing the following over and over again:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch an instruction </li>
<li>decode the instruction</li>
<li>execute the instruction </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the Von Neumann model of computing. <em>That.is.it.</em></p>
<p>However, just having a single program running at a time is boring.
As it stands it is a simple <a class="txt-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing">batch processing system</a>. You cannot run multiple programs at once and you cannot interact with the system while it is running your program. We want more. We need more.</p>
<p>The body of software that allows us to interact with our laptops in the way we do is called
the operating system. 
It enables multiple programs to run seemingly at the same time -- giving us the desktop "environment" we are used to.</p>
<p>As I am writing this in a text editor, my browser is open to the page containing this
lesson, music is playing from another tab on the browser, I have a status bar on the
bottom showing the time, volume, date, battery, and the status of my wireless connection. I also
have another workspace with a terminal window open. None of this would be
possible without the wild wild things the operating system does behind the scenes
while programs are seemingly just fetching, decoding and executing instructions.</p>
<p>So how does an operating system (or OS) do this magic? Three easy pieces; virtualization, concurrency and persistence.</p>
<h1 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h1><p>Virtualization: "Sharing one peach among many peach-eaters while making them think
they each have a peach to themselves"</p>
<h2 id="virtualizing-the-cpu">Virtualizing the CPU</h2><p>Program -- A program is a lifeless thing, sitting on disk. A bunch of
instructions and maybe some data, waiting to spring into action</p>
<p>Process -- A <em>running</em> program.</p>
<p>It is the operating system that takes a program and gets it running,
transforming it into something useful. The operating system needs a
CPU to "run" these programs in.</p>
<p>A usable computer should be able to run many programs at a
time. So how do we create the illusion of having multiple CPUs for these
programs to run on? How do we give the illusion of access other physical
resources that the computer might be connected to ?
The answer is clearly "virtualization"...but how does the
OS do that?</p>
<h3 id="mechanisms-and-policies">Mechanisms and policies</h3><p>Mechanisms are low-level operations, methods or protocols to implement a needed
piece of functionality. They represent the step-by-step details of how to do something.</p>
<p>Policies are the algorithms for making some kind of decision. For example, deciding
which process to run next.</p>
<p>Back to processes. Some terms</p>
<p><strong>Machine state</strong>: The parts of the machine that are important to the execution
of a running process. Some examples are</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory it can access, also called the <strong>address space</strong></li>
<li>The registers it makes use of. </li>
<li>The files it has open</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process API</strong>: The way you expect to be able to interact with a process. For
example, we should be able to create, destroy, and wait for a process. Other
operations might also be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Process List</strong>: Data structure that the OS uses to track information about
processes that are running, ready or blocked. The individual members in this
list are sometimes called PCBs (process control blocks) or process descriptors.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-process-creation">Mechanism: Process creation</h3><p>To have multiple processes running on the same computer, the operating system must be able to <em>create</em> them. These is the main application programming interface for process creation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>fork()</code> -&gt; Create a child process that starts executing at the same line that the parent process called the method</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>wait()</code> -&gt; Wait for child processes to finish</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>exec()</code> -&gt; Load another program into the current running program's address space and start executing that instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanism:-limited-direct-execution">Mechanism: Limited direct execution</h3><p>When a process is running on the CPU, nothing else is, including the operating system. So how can the OS (which is not running) manage processes (which are running)?</p>
<p>A mechanism called Limited Direct Execution is used.
The elements of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap instructions.<ul>
<li>These trap instructions give control to the hardware, which in turn gives control to the OS with additional privileges (kernel mode). The OS does its thing, then executes a return from trap instruction, which gives control back to the hardware, which in turn gives control back to the running program.</li>
<li>Normal programs can pass arguments to these trap instructions by placing values on the stack that are understood by the OS.</li>
<li>These are called "System Calls"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switching control between process:<ul>
<li>Cooperative approach: The OS waits for processes to make a system call or perform some illegal action that will give rise to a trap instruction. </li>
<li>Non-cooperative approach: Timer-interrupt. The OS sets up a timer that will interrupt the running code on the CPU every few milliseconds and execute a trap-like statement that will give control back to the OS. Hardware cooperation is needed for this one.</li>
<li>Once the OS regains control in some way, it needs to make a decision. To continue running the current process or switch to another one? This decision is the job of the scheduler. </li>
<li>Once the next process to be executed has been chosen, a context switch needs to happen. This means saving some state form the current running process, and fetching some state for the soon to be running process. Then return from trap my guy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="policy:-scheduling">Policy: Scheduling</h3><p>Some Definitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turnaround Time: The time from when the job entered the system to when it completes</p>
<p>Response Time: The time from when the job enters the system to when it first starts executing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different scheduling policies yield different results for these two metrics. In general, policies that are considered "fair" are terrible for turnaround time but good for response time.</p>
<p>Policies that are considered "efficient" are great at turnaround time, but terrible at response time.</p>
<p><em>Multi-Level-Feedback Queue Scheduler</em></p>
<p>The crux of the problem: "How can we design a scheduler that both minimizes response time for interactive jobs while also minimizing turnaround time without previous knowledge of job length?</p>
<p>We do so by coming up with the concept of job priorities.</p>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Priority(A) &gt; Priority(B), A runs (B does not)</li>
<li>If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A &amp; B run in round-robin fashion using the time slice of the given queue.</li>
<li>When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).</li>
<li>Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).</li>
<li>After some time period S, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appears to offer some balance between response and turnaround time which is what we wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Voo-doo" constants (term was created by John Ousterhout). What values should we pick for a time-slice for each queue? How many queues should we have? What should be the time allotment per-queue? What is the period <code>S</code> after which all jobs in the system move to the topmost queue? The questions go on...</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lottery Scheduling</em></p>
<p>Exactly what it sounds like. We pick the next process to run at random with the added twist that we can assign "weights" to certain processes so they are more likely to be picked.</p>
<p>The longer the processes run for the more "fair" this scheduling is as each process runs for exactly the proportion of time its weights corresponds to. These weights can be referred to as "tickets". The more tickets a process has, the more likely it is to be picked when the scheduler is deciding what job to run next.</p>
<p>The Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand. No voo-doo constants</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is none. All our schedulers should be of the lottery kind <code>._.</code> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aside: Linux uses a variant of this and calls it the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)
As each process runs, it accumulates vruntime. Once a time-slice is over, the scheduler simply picks the process with the lowest vruntime.</p>
<p>The time-slice is determined by another knob called <code>sched_latency</code>, which is (usually) the period over which the scheduler will be completely fair. It takes this value and divides it by the number of processes, which will give it the time-slice to use.</p>
<p>Yet another knob is used to make sure time-slices are not too short. This is the <code>min_granularity</code>, which is the minimum amount of time a time-slice should be. If the set <code>sched_latency</code> implies a value lower than <code>min_granularity</code>, it is set to <code>min_granularity</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="virtualizing-memory">Virtualizing memory</h2><p>We are not yet done with virtualization though. The OS also needs to virtualize any shared hardware that processes might want to use. This includes memory. The virtual memory manager is responsible for giving processes the illusion that they have a sequential block of memory to themselves. This is called the "address space" for process.</p>
<p>This goal of this illusion is <em>easy of use</em> and <em>protection</em>.<br>
It would be terrible to program in an environment where you needed to make sure you did not overwrite some other program's memory.<br>
It would also be terrible if other programs could overwrite your own memory.</p>
<p>In the early days of computing, this did not matter much. Computers only needed to only run a few jobs non-interactively. But humans are demanding and eventually we wanted our computers to be interactive! we wanted them fast and capable of running multiple programs at the same time! and they must support multiple concurrent users! <code>.__.</code> So OS designers had no choice. Virtual memory it is. Gone are the simple days</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-memory-allocation-api">Mechanism: Memory allocation API</h3><p>Generally, when running a program, there are two types of memory "stack" and "heap". The underlying operating system does not make this distinction. It's all just memory.<br>
However most programming languages introduce this concept to make a distinction between short-lived and long-lived memory.</p>
<p>Short-lived memory or stack memory only lasts within a function call.<br>
Long-lived memory or heap memory can last between function invocations.</p>
<p>Stack memory is usually automatically allocated AND de-allocated for you. Heap memory however, you need to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>In UNIX/C programs, two methods are available for allocating heap memory</p>
<ul>
<li><code>malloc</code> -&gt; You pass it the size of memory you would like allocated on the heap. If it succeeds, it returns the pointer to that memory</li>
<li><code>free</code> -&gt; Marks the memory pointed to the pointer argument as free to used again i.e. not-allocated</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not system calls. They are provided by the C standard library as easier interfaces to the <code>brk</code> and <code>sbrk</code> system calls.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-address-translation">Mechanism: Address translation</h3><p>The idea is the same with limited directed execution. The operating system must partner with the hardware to be able to provide a good memory interface to programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, running programs are made to think they have a continuous chunk of memory starting at 0 which they can use. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is not actually the case.</p>
<p>If multiple programs are to share memory, the OS needs to be able to place them at different spots in memory, which means the addresses the programs use will be wrong. To fix this issue, the OS uses <em>address translation</em> or <em>base and bounds</em>.</p>
<p>The idea is that the running program thinks it is accessing address 128 to get its next instruction. However, the next instruction for that program might not be at physical address 128 because of where the program was placed in memory. So the Operating System with great help from the hardware translates that 128 virtual address its physical address.</p>
<p>This is done by recording a base and bounds for every program. We can think of the <em>base</em> as the offset from 0 to where the program actually resides in memory. So when a program whose base is 10000 tries to access memory location 128, the hardware will actually translate that to the physical memory location 10128. 
The <em>bounds</em> helps enforce the rule that processes can only access their own memory. If a process tries to access memory greater than the <em>bounds</em>, the hardware can run a handler (set up by the OS) that will kill the offending process.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-segmentation">Mechanism: Segmentation</h3><p>If programmers were content creatures, we would be be content with having <em>base</em> and <em>bounds</em> registers. But no. We must have more flexibility. We cannot simply give each process a physical block of continuous address space! We need to be able to partition it and place its parts wherever we want, so we can be more memory-efficient and avoid wasted space!</p>
<p>And that is what happened and they called it "segmentation" and it added a few more registers to mark where different segments started, stopped and the direction in which they grew.</p>
<p>This is also the origin of the "segmentation fault" error we see in programs. It happens when we try to access memory in a segment that does not belong to us.</p>
<h3 id="free-memory-management">Free memory management</h3><p>Free memory management goes hand in hand with segmentation. Since the address space of a process is not one continuous range of memory, we need to come up with clever techniques for keeping track of free space.</p>
<p>In managing free space, there are a few considerations.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the interface we will presenting to the user? e.g. what is the process through which they can request memory? If the user is finished using a chunk of memory, is there a way they can signal that they do not need said chunk any longer? If so, how?</li>
<li>How will we map virtual addresses to physical ones?</li>
<li>How will we implement coalescing and splitting? <ul>
<li><strong>Splitting</strong>: When a user requests some free space, the allocator will find some chunk that can satisfy the request. It will break this chunk into two. The first part will be returned back to the caller and the second will be placed back into the free list. </li>
<li><strong>Coalescing</strong>: If a user no longer has need for a chunk of memory, the allocator should make sure to store neighboring chunks of memory as one big chunk instead of separate ones.</li>
<li>These two techniques help to minimize <em>external fragmentation</em> -- when free space gets chopped up into little pieces subsequent requests might fail to find one continuous chunk of memory that satisfies the demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mechanism:-paging">Mechanism: Paging</h3><p>With segmentation, we chop up free space into different size chunks using different policies to manage the fragmentation that occurs.<br>
Thankfully, not all computer scientists went crazy with using segmentation. We have mostly moved to using a different mechanism for managing memory -- paging. This is a much simpler technique where memory is represented as fixed-size chunks (or pages). In the context of physical memory, we use the term <em>page frames</em>. In the context of virtual memory (process address space), we use the term <em>virtual pages</em>, or just <em>pages</em>.</p>
<p>For this to work, each process needs to have a <em>page table</em> ~ a mapping from virtual pages to physical ones. To translate a virtual address to a physical one, we split the address into two parts: a virtual page number (VPN) and an offset. The vpn lets us know what virtual page the memory address is in and the offset is...well, the offset into that virtual page.<br>
This works well because given a continuous process address space, we can designate a portion of a the higher-order bits to represent the page number. As we move throughout the address space the page number/offset works because higher order bits get incremented slower than lower order bits, and when they do, the lower order bits "reset" to zero. This works both in binary and decimal. Food for thought.</p>
<p>So the page table is really just a data structure for mapping virtual page numbers to physical page numbers. In practice, we use it to store some other information about pages though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid bit: To support sparse address spaces, we can mark pages in a process address space as invalid if it is not currently being used. This allows the OS to avoid allocating physical page frames for those regions.</li>
<li>Protection bits: To support read/write/execute access for the contents of a page.</li>
<li>Present bit: Indicates whether this page is in memory or disk (will be talked about later)</li>
<li>Dirty bit: Indicates if the page has been modified since being brought into memory.
... many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you really think about it though, you realize that page tables can get big. We can no longer store the values we need to translate addresses in registers, we have to use memory. Another pretty big downside to this is that every memory access incurs more costs than usual because we have to make an additional fetch to get the page table from memory. More fetches might be necessary depending on how things are setup.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, i'm still a much bigger fan of paging that segmentation. It seems much "saner", the right thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="translation-lookaside-buffers">Translation lookaside buffers</h3><p>Paging on its own is slow because memory access is costly (relative to the cpu speed). So for paging to be practical, we need to find a way to deal with the page-table access penalty we get.</p>
<p>One of such ways is using an Address Translation Cache (for historical? reasons, it is called a Translation Lookaside Buffer). This will be a small, but fast area close to the cpu that will be used to store recent page table translations.<br>
The first time a process tries to translate a virtual page table to a physical one, we will have a <em>TLB miss</em> because the translation is not in the cache yet. So we grit our teeth, and fetch the page table from memory as usual. We then add that translation to the TLB. On subsequent requests to translate that page table, its a <em>TLB hit</em> because the translation exists in cache.</p>
<p>This mechanism works quite well because of spatial locality (if a process accesses a memory location, it is likely to access nearby memory locations) and temporal locality (if a process accesses a memory location, it is likely to access it again in the near future).
Loading a page table translation into the TLB means that subsequent address translation that fit within that page table will be TLB hits and thus fast. WIN.</p>
<p>If it's easy, you are missing something. That's my new motto for Operating System things. Speaking of which, we are missing something. Context switches. Since each process has its own page table, processes cannot share the TLB. UGH. There are a few ways to deal with this. One is to flush the TLB on a context switch, so that each process starts with a fresh TLB. The downside of this is that each process starts with a fresh TLB, so all the caching work just goes down the drain. Another approach is to allow multiple processes to use the TLB, but differentiate which entry belongs to which process by using an "Address Space Identifier" or ASI. The downside of this is that processes need to share the already small TLB, so even fewer translations can be cached.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of cache eviction. As the quote goes "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things". The TLB will eventually get full, but subsequent translations will still need to be saved. How do we decide which entry to evict? TBD.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-paging">Advanced paging</h3><p>Do not let the word "advanced" scare you off. Stay. It's "fun".<br>
Anyways, the previous section on the TLB was about how we can avoid the expensive additional calls to memory when using the paging technique for memory virtualization (yes, this is still about memory virtualization. See the hole we have dug for ourselves?).</p>
<p>If you recall, paging actually had two problems. We addressed the first one ~ we reduce the number of calls to memory by introducing caching. But we have yet to address the second one: Page tables get big.</p>
<p>Page tables get big because we need a page table entry for each page within a process address space, whether it is being used by the process or not. Lots of wasted space.<br>
One way to reduce the space taken up by the page table is to increase the page size. This means less pages, which means less entries, which means smaller page table? <em>Let's not get too hasty, my simple-minded friend.</em>
Bigger page sizes now means that a process might be given more memory that it needs. This leads to "internal fragmentation" ~ applications end up allocating pages but only using small bits and pieces of each, filling up memory with barely used areas.</p>
<p>Out of the many other solutions, I will just point out three, because if you <em>really</em> think about it, this is not a textbook, but notes about one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid between segmentation and paging: Honestly, I do not fully understand this one, neither do I care about it. I am morally against segmentation. Pass.</li>
<li>Multi-Level Page Tables: Instead of having one page table, you have a hierarchical  structure of tables. The base case is our normal page table. You have a normal table that tells you, for each page, whether it is allocated or not. If it is allocated it will also tell you what the physical page frame is. For your average process, only a small part of the entries in this page table will be pointing to actual physical frames. The rest only exist to tell you they are not pointing to anything. 
A 2-Level page table solves that a bit, by breaking up this initial page table (call it A) into equally-sized chunks that are then pointed to by another table (call it B).The twist is that if all the page table entries in a chunk of table A do not point to anything, we can omit that chunk from A and simply have the corresponding entry in B mark it as unallocated. Savings. This "trick" can be repeated as many times as needed, hence "Multi-Level" page tables.<br>
It's important to understand that we have traded space for complexity though. We solved the space problem, but now we have a complexity problem. These types of trade-offs show up all over operating system design, and usually people are willing to take on complexity to save on some space or performance. I am not happy about it, but I guess we have to make do with what we have.  </li>
<li>Inverse Page Table: This one surprised me. The idea is to say NO to per-process page tables. We will have one big page table for all the processes. Instead of listing a mapping from a virtual page number to a physical page number, it will do the opposite: list a mapping from every physical page frame number to whatever virtual page number points to it. With this approach, the data structure used becomes really important since our table cannot be a normal list. Think about how you would find what physical page frame number corresponds to your virtual page number. Every page table access would require checking the table sequentially. Except it is a huge table because it has as many entries as there are pages in the system's memory. So this cannot be a list, but needs to be some other well thought through data structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="swap-space">Swap space</h3><p>Recall that one of the reasons virtualization exists in the first place is to give the illusion that interacting with the hardware is easier that it actually is. This is a good thing. Yet another thing we need to figure out to make such an illusion seamless is address the case when a process needs an address space greater than what can fit into memory.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this magic is not all that complicated. We have a small, but fast TLB (address translation cache). We have a bigger but slower memory (RAM). Now it's time to introduce the much bigger, but much slower "disk". This could be a hard drive (HD) or a solid state drive (SSD). It's big, permanent and slow storage. If there is no space in memory to fit an address space, and THE SHOW MUST GO ON, we have no option but to start throwing address spaces onto disk.</p>
<p>This process of <em>swapping pages from memory to disk and vice versa</em> is controlled by the <em>present bit</em> in a process's page table. The bit will tell us if that page is present in memory or not. 
This process must be done carefully though. If memory is full, we need a way to choose which pages to move to disk. Ideally, these would be pages that are not frequently accessed.</p>
<p>The act of moving pages in and out of swap space is done by the <em>swap daemon</em> or <em>page daemon</em>. This is a special process the operating system will run when it notices that there are fewer than a certain number of pages in memory. This "certain number" is called the "Low Watermark".
The special process will run until there are at least another certain number of pages in memory. This "another certain number" is called the "High Watermark".</p>
<p><em>When we are low on memory, how does the OS decide which pages to evict?</em></p>
<p>Given that main memory holds a subset of all the pages in the system, it can be viewed as a sort of cache. Our goal is to minimize cache misses (or maximize cache hits). The number of cache hits/misses lets us calculate the <em>AMAT (Average Memory Access Time)</em> which is a metric we can use to compare how different memory swap policies compare to each other.</p>
<p>The formula for AMAT is straightforward: <code>AMAT = "Time to access memory" + ("Probability of a page fault" * "Time to access disk")</code></p>
<p>What this formula means is that a page fault is costly because accessing disk after a page fault takes A LOT more time to do than accessing memory. I do not know exactly how much longer it takes, but the difference is pretty huge. Do not take it lightly. This is why reducing the probability of a page fault is very important.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Optimal Replacement Policy: Evict the page that will be accessed furthest in the future. This policy has been show to be the best we can do for caches. However it is not practical because the future is not usually known. It does serve as a good comparison point for the other policies that we can implement.</li>
<li>FIFO (first in first out): First page in is the first to get evicted when we need to evict. Generally bad policy in this case. </li>
<li>Random: We pick a page to evict at random. Depends on how lucky the process is. </li>
<li>The family of history-related policies (LRU, LFU): Least-Recently-Used and Least-Frequently-Used are sibling policies among a family of policies that decide the future based on the past (think back to scheduling). These policies will do well in cases where programs exhibit locality (specifically temporal locality). Most programs exhibit this, but do not think of it as a hard-and-fast rule.<ul>
<li>If implementing these policies, we need to keep track of how many times the page has been accessed (or when last it was accessed). Turns out that this is not practical for large number of pages since we will need to scan all the pages before we can decide on which to evict. Thankfully, we can fudge this using the "clock algorithm" which gives us a good approximation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we need to remember that if a page was modified while in memory, we need to write it back to disk before evicting it. We cannot simply disgard it from memory. Hence what is called the <em>dirty bit</em> to flag that certain pages in memory have been modified since they were swapped into memory. When such a page is being evicted, we will need to write it to disk (which is expensive) first. If page is not dirty, no write is necessary and it can be immediately used.</p>
<p>Lastly, <em>thrashing</em> is what happens when we simply do not have enough physical memory and are constantly swapping pages in and out of disk. Different approaches have been created to deal with this. Some operating systems implement mechanisms to limit the processes that will be run. This is called <em>admission control</em>. Other operating systems might implement an <em>out-of-memory-killer</em> process that will choose a memory-intensive process and kill it. This is risky if it kills an important process (X.org on linux for example).</p>
<p>But let us be honest. The REAL solution to thrashing is "buy more memory"</p>
<h1 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h1><p>To keep on with the peach analogy, imagine you have a group of people around a table full of peaches. Each person would like a peach. How do we get them all to get their peaches as fast as possible but without tripping over each other?</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-threads">Introduction to threads</h2><p>Up till now, we have implicitly assumed that a process (i.e. a running program) is sequential, it runs one instruction, then the next, then the next. While this is true, it is possible to provide yet another layer of virtualization called <em>threads</em>.<br>
Why do this? Because first, our computers have evolved to have multiple processors, so the software must evolve as well to make use of them. Second, having  multiple threads in a program allows for continuing useful work on one thread even when the other threads might be waiting for I/O. Third, all the threads for in single process share the same address space. (This is both a pro and a con, but that's a discussion for another time).</p>
<p>Apart from the shared address space part, threads and processes are similar. Both are things that don't actually exist, but the OS makes us believe they do. Both have data structures holding per-item state like the registers that are being used and their values. Both are run on the cpu(s) at the whim of the hopefully smart scheduler. Both need to be context-switched.</p>
<h2 id="thread-api">Thread api</h2><p>I was not going to have a section for this chapter, but the book had a very funny paragraph that I want to reproduce here. It is talking about thread creation, and the author just finished giving an example on how to perform it. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"And there it is! Once you create a thread, you really have another live executing entity, complete with its own call stack, running within the same address space as all the currently existing threads in the program. <em>The fun thus begins!</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="thread-locking">Thread locking</h2><p>Thread concurrency comes with a host of problems because it introduces shared state. One such class of problem is a "data race", which is the behavior that occurs when two threads try to access shared data at the same time. What to do?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, we <em>could</em> just abandon threads altogether and look to other techniques such as message passing for concurrency (note the hint of sarcasm). However, even my cynical self has to admit that thread concurrency has its perks. It would be a damn shame not to have it.</li>
<li>Thread locking: We introduce a mechanism for making access to shared sequential -- only one thread can do so at a time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's backtrack a bit. The reason why two threads accessing shared data at the same time is a problem is that they might not do so in an <em>atomic</em> way. And because of this, at any point during the process of updating this piece of shared data, they might be pre-empted by the operating system scheduler and another thread might run, which could then try to also update the same piece of shared data, leading to potential data corruption. The solution to this problem is to make sure that whenever a thread starts executing some operation on shared data (i.e. executing in the <em>critical path</em>), it is the only thread doing so.</p>
<p>This is achieved via locks, also called mutexes. When a thread acquires a lock, it can start executing the critical path, then give up the lock once done. If other threads come around and try to execute the critical path, they will be unable to acquire the lock, and thus must wait until it is free before they can go any further.</p>
<p>Let's dig deeper then. How are locks implemented? Locks are supposed to guarantee that a certain operation will only be executed by one thread without interruption. How do we guarantee that the OS won't interrupt and schedule another thread to run that same operation before the first thread is done? Surprise, we will probably need some help from the hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locks could be implemented as "Disabling Interrupts". This works, but is bad for a few reasons:<ul>
<li>We are allowing the calling thread to execute a <em>privileged</em> operation. A rogue program could take a lock and never release it. The OS would never be able to regain control of the system.</li>
<li>This is tricky/does not work on multiple processors. The disabling of interrupts is on a processor level, so other threads on other processors will still be able to proceed with the critical section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loads/Stores: The hardware sets a flag in memory that signals that a thread is executing the critical section. If another thread comes a long, it will not be allowed to proceed until the flag is unset. This is called a <em>spin lock</em>, because any thread that tries to take the lock while it is, well, <em>locked</em>, will sit in a loop, waiting, wasting cpu cycles.<ul>
<li>This basic load/store does not work. One can imagine a situation where two threads take a lock at the same time because loading, setting then storing something in memory is not an atomic operation. This behavior is what professionals call "bad". </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Atomic variants of load/store: There are various hardware-implemented atomic variants of load and store that work (e.g. test and set, compare-and-swap, load-linked and store con---

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p>When we say a program is "running" we mean that a program is doing the following over and over again:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch an instruction </li>
<li>decode the instruction</li>
<li>execute the instruction </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the Von Neumann model of computing. <em>That.is.it.</em></p>
<p>However, just having a single program running at a time is boring.
As it stands it is a simple <a class="txt-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing">batch processing system</a>. You cannot run multiple programs at once and you cannot interact with the system while it is running your program. We want more. We need more.</p>
<p>The body of software that allows us to interact with our laptops in the way we do is called
the operating system. 
It enables multiple programs to run seemingly at the same time -- giving us the desktop "environment" we are used to.</p>
<p>As I am writing this in a text editor, my browser is open to the page containing this
lesson, music is playing from another tab on the browser, I have a status bar on the
bottom showing the time, volume, date, battery, and the status of my wireless connection. I also
have another workspace with a terminal window open. None of this would be
possible without the wild wild things the operating system does behind the scenes
while programs are seemingly just fetching, decoding and executing instructions.</p>
<p>So how does an operating system (or OS) do this magic? Three easy pieces; virtualization, concurrency and persistence.</p>
<h1 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h1><p>Virtualization: "Sharing one peach among many peach-eaters while making them think
they each have a peach to themselves"</p>
<h2 id="virtualizing-the-cpu">Virtualizing the CPU</h2><p>Program -- A program is a lifeless thing, sitting on disk. A bunch of
instructions and maybe some data, waiting to spring into action</p>
<p>Process -- A <em>running</em> program.</p>
<p>It is the operating system that takes a program and gets it running,
transforming it into something useful. The operating system needs a
CPU to "run" these programs in.</p>
<p>A usable computer should be able to run many programs at a
time. So how do we create the illusion of having multiple CPUs for these
programs to run on? How do we give the illusion of access other physical
resources that the computer might be connected to ?
The answer is clearly "virtualization"...but how does the
OS do that?</p>
<h3 id="mechanisms-and-policies">Mechanisms and policies</h3><p>Mechanisms are low-level operations, methods or protocols to implement a needed
piece of functionality. They represent the step-by-step details of how to do something.</p>
<p>Policies are the algorithms for making some kind of decision. For example, deciding
which process to run next.</p>
<p>Back to processes. Some terms</p>
<p><strong>Machine state</strong>: The parts of the machine that are important to the execution
of a running process. Some examples are</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory it can access, also called the <strong>address space</strong></li>
<li>The registers it makes use of. </li>
<li>The files it has open</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process API</strong>: The way you expect to be able to interact with a process. For
example, we should be able to create, destroy, and wait for a process. Other
operations might also be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Process List</strong>: Data structure that the OS uses to track information about
processes that are running, ready or blocked. The individual members in this
list are sometimes called PCBs (process control blocks) or process descriptors.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-process-creation">Mechanism: Process creation</h3><p>To have multiple processes running on the same computer, the operating system must be able to <em>create</em> them. These is the main application programming interface for process creation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>fork()</code> -&gt; Create a child process that starts executing at the same line that the parent process called the method</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>wait()</code> -&gt; Wait for child processes to finish</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>exec()</code> -&gt; Load another program into the current running program's address space and start executing that instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanism:-limited-direct-execution">Mechanism: Limited direct execution</h3><p>When a process is running on the CPU, nothing else is, including the operating system. So how can the OS (which is not running) manage processes (which are running)?</p>
<p>A mechanism called Limited Direct Execution is used.
The elements of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap instructions.<ul>
<li>These trap instructions give control to the hardware, which in turn gives control to the OS with additional privileges (kernel mode). The OS does its thing, then executes a return from trap instruction, which gives control back to the hardware, which in turn gives control back to the running program.</li>
<li>Normal programs can pass arguments to these trap instructions by placing values on the stack that are understood by the OS.</li>
<li>These are called "System Calls"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switching control between process:<ul>
<li>Cooperative approach: The OS waits for processes to make a system call or perform some illegal action that will give rise to a trap instruction. </li>
<li>Non-cooperative approach: Timer-interrupt. The OS sets up a timer that will interrupt the running code on the CPU every few milliseconds and execute a trap-like statement that will give control back to the OS. Hardware cooperation is needed for this one.</li>
<li>Once the OS regains control in some way, it needs to make a decision. To continue running the current process or switch to another one? This decision is the job of the scheduler. </li>
<li>Once the next process to be executed has been chosen, a context switch needs to happen. This means saving some state form the current running process, and fetching some state for the soon to be running process. Then return from trap my guy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="policy:-scheduling">Policy: Scheduling</h3><p>Some Definitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turnaround Time: The time from when the job entered the system to when it completes</p>
<p>Response Time: The time from when the job enters the system to when it first starts executing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different scheduling policies yield different results for these two metrics. In general, policies that are considered "fair" are terrible for turnaround time but good for response time.</p>
<p>Policies that are considered "efficient" are great at turnaround time, but terrible at response time.</p>
<p><em>Multi-Level-Feedback Queue Scheduler</em></p>
<p>The crux of the problem: "How can we design a scheduler that both minimizes response time for interactive jobs while also minimizing turnaround time without previous knowledge of job length?</p>
<p>We do so by coming up with the concept of job priorities.</p>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Priority(A) &gt; Priority(B), A runs (B does not)</li>
<li>If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A &amp; B run in round-robin fashion using the time slice of the given queue.</li>
<li>When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).</li>
<li>Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).</li>
<li>After some time period S, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appears to offer some balance between response and turnaround time which is what we wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Voo-doo" constants (term was created by John Ousterhout). What values should we pick for a time-slice for each queue? How many queues should we have? What should be the time allotment per-queue? What is the period <code>S</code> after which all jobs in the system move to the topmost queue? The questions go on...</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lottery Scheduling</em></p>
<p>Exactly what it sounds like. We pick the next process to run at random with the added twist that we can assign "weights" to certain processes so they are more likely to be picked.</p>
<p>The longer the processes run for the more "fair" this scheduling is as each process runs for exactly the proportion of time its weights corresponds to. These weights can be referred to as "tickets". The more tickets a process has, the more likely it is to be picked when the scheduler is deciding what job to run next.</p>
<p>The Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand. No voo-doo constants</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is none. All our schedulers should be of the lottery kind <code>._.</code> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aside: Linux uses a variant of this and calls it the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)
As each process runs, it accumulates vruntime. Once a time-slice is over, the scheduler simply picks the process with the lowest vruntime.</p>
<p>The time-slice is determined by another knob called <code>sched_latency</code>, which is (usually) the period over which the scheduler will be completely fair. It takes this value and divides it by the number of processes, which will give it the time-slice to use.</p>
<p>Yet another knob is used to make sure time-slices are not too short. This is the <code>min_granularity</code>, which is the minimum amount of time a time-slice should be. If the set <code>sched_latency</code> implies a value lower than <code>min_granularity</code>, it is set to <code>min_granularity</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="virtualizing-memory">Virtualizing memory</h2><p>We are not yet done with virtualization though. The OS also needs to virtualize any shared hardware that processes might want to use. This includes memory. The virtual memory manager is responsible for giving processes the illusion that they have a sequential block of memory to themselves. This is called the "address space" for process.</p>
<p>This goal of this illusion is <em>easy of use</em> and <em>protection</em>.<br>
It would be terrible to program in an environment where you needed to make sure you did not overwrite some other program's memory.<br>
It would also be terrible if other programs could overwrite your own memory.</p>
<p>In the early days of computing, this did not matter much. Computers only needed to only run a few jobs non-interactively. But humans are demanding and eventually we wanted our computers to be interactive! we wanted them fast and capable of running multiple programs at the same time! and they must support multiple concurrent users! <code>.__.</code> So OS designers had no choice. Virtual memory it is. Gone are the simple days</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-memory-allocation-api">Mechanism: Memory allocation API</h3><p>Generally, when running a program, there are two types of memory "stack" and "heap". The underlying operating system does not make this distinction. It's all just memory.<br>
However most programming languages introduce this concept to make a distinction between short-lived and long-lived memory.</p>
<p>Short-lived memory or stack memory only lasts within a function call.<br>
Long-lived memory or heap memory can last between function invocations.</p>
<p>Stack memory is usually automatically allocated AND de-allocated for you. Heap memory however, you need to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>In UNIX/C programs, two methods are available for allocating heap memory</p>
<ul>
<li><code>malloc</code> -&gt; You pass it the size of memory you would like allocated on the heap. If it succeeds, it returns the pointer to that memory</li>
<li><code>free</code> -&gt; Marks the memory pointed to the pointer argument as free to used again i.e. not-allocated</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not system calls. They are provided by the C standard library as easier interfaces to the <code>brk</code> and <code>sbrk</code> system calls.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-address-translation">Mechanism: Address translation</h3><p>The idea is the same with limited directed execution. The operating system must partner with the hardware to be able to provide a good memory interface to programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, running programs are made to think they have a continuous chunk of memory starting at 0 which they can use. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is not actually the case.</p>
<p>If multiple programs are to share memory, the OS needs to be able to place them at different spots in memory, which means the addresses the programs use will be wrong. To fix this issue, the OS uses <em>address translation</em> or <em>base and bounds</em>.</p>
<p>The idea is that the running program thinks it is accessing address 128 to get its next instruction. However, the next instruction for that program might not be at physical address 128 because of where the program was placed in memory. So the Operating System with great help from the hardware translates that 128 virtual address its physical address.</p>
<p>This is done by recording a base and bounds for every program. We can think of the <em>base</em> as the offset from 0 to where the program actually resides in memory. So when a program whose base is 10000 tries to access memory location 128, the hardware will actually translate that to the physical memory location 10128. 
The <em>bounds</em> helps enforce the rule that processes can only access their own memory. If a process tries to access memory greater than the <em>bounds</em>, the hardware can run a handler (set up by the OS) that will kill the offending process.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism:-segmentation">Mechanism: Segmentation</h3><p>If programmers were content creatures, we would be be content with having <em>base</em> and <em>bounds</em> registers. But no. We must have more flexibility. We cannot simply give each process a physical block of continuous address space! We need to be able to partition it and place its parts wherever we want, so we can be more memory-efficient and avoid wasted space!</p>
<p>And that is what happened and they called it "segmentation" and it added a few more registers to mark where different segments started, stopped and the direction in which they grew.</p>
<p>This is also the origin of the "segmentation fault" error we see in programs. It happens when we try to access memory in a segment that does not belong to us.</p>
<h3 id="free-memory-management">Free memory management</h3><p>Free memory management goes hand in hand with segmentation. Since the address space of a process is not one continuous range of memory, we need to come up with clever techniques for keeping track of free space.</p>
<p>In managing free space, there are a few considerations.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the interface we will presenting to the user? e.g. what is the process through which they can request memory? If the user is finished using a chunk of memory, is there a way they can signal that they do not need said chunk any longer? If so, how?</li>
<li>How will we map virtual addresses to physical ones?</li>
<li>How will we implement coalescing and splitting? <ul>
<li><strong>Splitting</strong>: When a user requests some free space, the allocator will find some chunk that can satisfy the request. It will break this chunk into two. The first part will be returned back to the caller and the second will be placed back into the free list. </li>
<li><strong>Coalescing</strong>: If a user no longer has need for a chunk of memory, the allocator should make sure to store neighboring chunks of memory as one big chunk instead of separate ones.</li>
<li>These two techniques help to minimize <em>external fragmentation</em> -- when free space gets chopped up into little pieces subsequent requests might fail to find one continuous chunk of memory that satisfies the demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mechanism:-paging">Mechanism: Paging</h3><p>With segmentation, we chop up free space into different size chunks using different policies to manage the fragmentation that occurs.<br>
Thankfully, not all computer scientists went crazy with using segmentation. We have mostly moved to using a different mechanism for managing memory -- paging. This is a much simpler technique where memory is represented as fixed-size chunks (or pages). In the context of physical memory, we use the term <em>page frames</em>. In the context of virtual memory (process address space), we use the term <em>virtual pages</em>, or just <em>pages</em>.</p>
<p>For this to work, each process needs to have a <em>page table</em> ~ a mapping from virtual pages to physical ones. To translate a virtual address to a physical one, we split the address into two parts: a virtual page number (VPN) and an offset. The vpn lets us know what virtual page the memory address is in and the offset is...well, the offset into that virtual page.<br>
This works well because given a continuous process address space, we can designate a portion of a the higher-order bits to represent the page number. As we move throughout the address space the page number/offset works because higher order bits get incremented slower than lower order bits, and when they do, the lower order bits "reset" to zero. This works both in binary and decimal. Food for thought.</p>
<p>So the page table is really just a data structure for mapping virtual page numbers to physical page numbers. In practice, we use it to store some other information about pages though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid bit: To support sparse address spaces, we can mark pages in a process address space as invalid if it is not currently being used. This allows the OS to avoid allocating physical page frames for those regions.</li>
<li>Protection bits: To support read/write/execute access for the contents of a page.</li>
<li>Present bit: Indicates whether this page is in memory or disk (will be talked about later)</li>
<li>Dirty bit: Indicates if the page has been modified since being brought into memory.
... many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you really think about it though, you realize that page tables can get big. We can no longer store the values we need to translate addresses in registers, we have to use memory. Another pretty big downside to this is that every memory access incurs more costs than usual because we have to make an additional fetch to get the page table from memory. More fetches might be necessary depending on how things are setup.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am still a much bigger fan of paging that segmentation. It seems much "saner", the right thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="translation-lookaside-buffers">Translation lookaside buffers</h3><p>Paging on its own is slow because memory access is costly (relative to the cpu speed). So for paging to be practical, we need to find a way to deal with the page-table access penalty we get.</p>
<p>One of such ways is using an Address Translation Cache (for historical? reasons, it is called a Translation Lookaside Buffer). This will be a small, but fast area close to the cpu that will be used to store recent page table translations.<br>
The first time a process tries to translate a virtual page table to a physical one, we will have a <em>TLB miss</em> because the translation is not in the cache yet. So we grit our teeth, and fetch the page table from memory as usual. We then add that translation to the TLB. On subsequent requests to translate that page table, its a <em>TLB hit</em> because the translation exists in cache.</p>
<p>This mechanism works quite well because of spatial locality (if a process accesses a memory location, it is likely to access nearby memory locations) and temporal locality (if a process accesses a memory location, it is likely to access it again in the near future).
Loading a page table translation into the TLB means that subsequent address translation that fit within that page table will be TLB hits and thus fast. WIN.</p>
<p>If it's easy, you are missing something. That's my new motto for Operating System things. Speaking of which, we are missing something. Context switches. Since each process has its own page table, processes cannot share the TLB. UGH. There are a few ways to deal with this. One is to flush the TLB on a context switch, so that each process starts with a fresh TLB. The downside of this is that each process starts with a fresh TLB, so all the caching work just goes down the drain. Another approach is to allow multiple processes to use the TLB, but differentiate which entry belongs to which process by using an "Address Space Identifier" or ASI. The downside of this is that processes need to share the already small TLB, so even fewer translations can be cached.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of cache eviction. As the quote goes "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things". The TLB will eventually get full, but subsequent translations will still need to be saved. How do we decide which entry to evict? TBD.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-paging">Advanced paging</h3><p>Do not let the word "advanced" scare you off. Stay. It's "fun".<br>
Anyways, the previous section on the TLB was about how we can avoid the expensive additional calls to memory when using the paging technique for memory virtualization (yes, this is still about memory virtualization. See the hole we have dug for ourselves?).</p>
<p>If you recall, paging actually had two problems. We addressed the first one ~ we reduce the number of calls to memory by introducing caching. But we have yet to address the second one: Page tables get big.</p>
<p>Page tables get big because we need a page table entry for each page within a process address space, whether it is being used by the process or not. Lots of wasted space.<br>
One way to reduce the space taken up by the page table is to increase the page size. This means less pages, which means less entries, which means smaller page table? <em>Let's not get too hasty, my simple-minded friend.</em>
Bigger page sizes now means that a process might be given more memory that it needs. This leads to "internal fragmentation" ~ applications end up allocating pages but only using small bits and pieces of each, filling up memory with barely used areas.</p>
<p>Out of the many other solutions, I will just point out three, because if you <em>really</em> think about it, this is not a textbook, but notes about one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid between segmentation and paging: Honestly, I do not fully understand this one, neither do I care about it. I am morally against segmentation. Pass.</li>
<li>Multi-Level Page Tables: Instead of having one page table, you have a hierarchical  structure of tables. The base case is our normal page table. You have a normal table that tells you, for each page, whether it is allocated or not. If it is allocated it will also tell you what the physical page frame is. For your average process, only a small part of the entries in this page table will be pointing to actual physical frames. The rest only exist to tell you they are not pointing to anything. 
A 2-Level page table solves that a bit, by breaking up this initial page table (call it A) into equally-sized chunks that are then pointed to by another table (call it B). The twist is that if all the page table entries in a chunk of table A do not point to anything, we can omit that chunk from A and simply have the corresponding entry in B mark it as de-allocated. Savings. This "trick" can be repeated as many times as needed, hence "Multi-Level" page tables.<br>
It's important to understand that we have traded space for complexity though. We solved the space problem, but now we have a complexity problem. These types of trade-offs show up all over operating system design, and usually people are willing to take on complexity to save on some space or performance. I am not happy about it, but I guess we have to make do with what we have.  </li>
<li>Inverse Page Table: This one surprised me. The idea is to say NO to per-process page tables. We will have one big page table for all the processes. Instead of listing a mapping from a virtual page number to a physical page number, it will do the opposite: list a mapping from every physical page frame number to whatever virtual page number points to it. With this approach, the data structure used becomes really important since our table cannot be a normal list. Think about how you would find what physical page frame number corresponds to your virtual page number. Every page table access would require checking the table sequentially. Except it is a huge table because it has as many entries as there are pages in the system's memory. So this cannot be a list, but needs to be some other well thought through data structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="swap-space">Swap space</h3><p>Recall that one of the reasons virtualization exists in the first place is to give the illusion that interacting with the hardware is easier that it actually is. This is a good thing. Yet another thing we need to figure out to make such an illusion seamless is address the case when a process needs an address space greater than what can fit into memory.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this magic is not all that complicated. We have a small, but fast TLB (address translation cache). We have a bigger but slower memory (RAM). Now it's time to introduce the much bigger, but much slower "disk". This could be a hard drive (HD) or a solid state drive (SSD). It's big, permanent and slow storage. If there is no space in memory to fit an address space, and THE SHOW MUST GO ON, we have no option but to start throwing address spaces onto disk.</p>
<p>This process of <em>swapping pages from memory to disk and vice versa</em> is controlled by the <em>present bit</em> in a process's page table. The bit will tell us if that page is present in memory or not. 
This process must be done carefully though. If memory is full, we need a way to choose which pages to move to disk. Ideally, these would be pages that are not frequently accessed.</p>
<p>The act of moving pages in and out of swap space is done by the <em>swap daemon</em> or <em>page daemon</em>. This is a special process the operating system will run when it notices that there are fewer than a certain number of pages in memory. This "certain number" is called the "Low Watermark".
The special process will run until there are at least another certain number of pages in memory. This "another certain number" is called the "High Watermark".</p>
<p><em>When we are low on memory, how does the OS decide which pages to evict?</em></p>
<p>Given that main memory holds a subset of all the pages in the system, it can be viewed as a sort of cache. Our goal is to minimize cache misses (or maximize cache hits). The number of cache hits/misses lets us calculate the <em>AMAT (Average Memory Access Time)</em> which is a metric we can use to compare how different memory swap policies compare to each other.</p>
<p>The formula for AMAT is straightforward: <code>AMAT = "Time to access memory" + ("Probability of a page fault" * "Time to access disk")</code></p>
<p>What this formula means is that a page fault is costly because accessing disk after a page fault takes A LOT more time to do than accessing memory. I do not know exactly how much longer it takes, but the difference is pretty huge. Do not take it lightly. This is why reducing the probability of a page fault is very important.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Optimal Replacement Policy: Evict the page that will be accessed furthest in the future. This policy has been show to be the best we can do for caches. However it is not practical because the future is not usually known. It does serve as a good comparison point for the other policies that we can implement.</li>
<li>FIFO (first in first out): First page in is the first to get evicted when we need to evict. Generally bad policy in this case. </li>
<li>Random: We pick a page to evict at random. Depends on how lucky the process is. </li>
<li>The family of history-related policies (LRU, LFU): Least-Recently-Used and Least-Frequently-Used are sibling policies among a family of policies that decide the future based on the past (think back to scheduling). These policies will do well in cases where programs exhibit locality (specifically temporal locality). Most programs exhibit this, but do not think of it as a hard-and-fast rule.<ul>
<li>If implementing these policies, we need to keep track of how many times the page has been accessed (or when last it was accessed). Turns out that this is not practical for large number of pages since we will need to scan all the pages before we can decide on which to evict. Thankfully, we can fudge this using the "clock algorithm" which gives us a good approximation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we need to remember that if a page was modified while in memory, we need to write it back to disk before evicting it. We cannot simply disgard it from memory. Hence what is called the <em>dirty bit</em> to flag that certain pages in memory have been modified since they were swapped into memory. When such a page is being evicted, we will need to write it to disk (which is expensive) first. If page is not dirty, no write is necessary and it can be immediately used.</p>
<p>Lastly, <em>thrashing</em> is what happens when we simply do not have enough physical memory and are constantly swapping pages in and out of disk. Different approaches have been created to deal with this. Some operating systems implement mechanisms to limit the processes that will be run. This is called <em>admission control</em>. Other operating systems might implement an <em>out-of-memory-killer</em> process that will choose a memory-intensive process and kill it. This is risky if it kills an important process (X.org on linux for example).</p>
<p>But let us be honest. The REAL solution to thrashing is "buy more memory"</p>
<h1 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h1><p>To keep on with the peach analogy, imagine you have a group of people around a table full of peaches. Each person would like a peach. How do we get them all to get their peaches as fast as possible but without tripping over each other?</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-threads">Introduction to threads</h2><p>Up till now, we have implicitly assumed that a process (i.e. a running program) is sequential, it runs one instruction, then the next, then the next. While this is true, it is possible to provide yet another layer of virtualization called <em>threads</em>.<br>
Why do this? Because first, our computers have evolved to have multiple processors, so the software must evolve as well to make use of them. Second, having  multiple threads in a program allows for continuing useful work on one thread even when the other threads might be waiting for I/O. Third, all the threads for in single process share the same address space. (This is both a pro and a con, but that's a discussion for another time).</p>
<p>Apart from the shared address space part, threads and processes are similar. Both are things that don't actually exist, but the OS makes us believe they do. Both have data structures holding per-item state like the registers that are being used and their values. Both are run on the CPU(s) at the whim of the hopefully smart scheduler. Both need to be context-switched.</p>
<h2 id="thread-api">Thread API</h2><p>I was not going to have a section for this chapter, but the book had a very funny paragraph that I want to reproduce here. It is talking about thread creation, and the author just finished giving an example on how to perform it. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"And there it is! Once you create a thread, you really have another live executing entity, complete with its own call stack, running within the same address space as all the currently existing threads in the program. <em>The fun thus begins!</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="thread-locking">Thread locking</h2><p>Thread concurrency comes with a host of problems because it introduces shared state. One such class of problem is a "data race", which is the behavior that occurs when two threads try to access shared data at the same time. What to do?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, we <em>could</em> just abandon threads altogether and look to other techniques such as message passing for concurrency (note the hint of sarcasm). However, even my cynical self has to admit that thread concurrency has its perks. It would be a damn shame not to have it.</li>
<li>Thread locking: We introduce a mechanism for making access to shared sequential -- only one thread can do so at a time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's backtrack a bit. The reason why two threads accessing shared data at the same time is a problem is that they might not do so in an <em>atomic</em> way. And because of this, at any point during the process of updating this piece of shared data, they might be preempted by the operating system scheduler and another thread might run, which could then try to also update the same piece of shared data, leading to potential data corruption. The solution to this problem is to make sure that whenever a thread starts executing some operation on shared data (i.e. executing in the <em>critical path</em>), it is the only thread doing so.</p>
<p>This is achieved via locks, also called mutexes. When a thread acquires a lock, it can start executing the critical path, then give up the lock once done. If other threads come around and try to execute the critical path, they will be unable to acquire the lock, and thus must wait until it is free before they can go any further.</p>
<p>Let's dig deeper then. How are locks implemented? Locks are supposed to guarantee that a certain operation will only be executed by one thread without interruption. How do we guarantee that the OS won't interrupt and schedule another thread to run that same operation before the first thread is done? Surprise, we will probably need some help from the hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locks could be implemented as "Disabling Interrupts". This works, but is bad for a few reasons:<ul>
<li>We are allowing the calling thread to execute a <em>privileged</em> operation. A rogue program could take a lock and never release it. The OS would never be able to regain control of the system.</li>
<li>This is tricky/does not work on multiple processors. The disabling of interrupts is on a processor level, so other threads on other processors will still be able to proceed with the critical section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loads/Stores: The hardware sets a flag in memory that signals that a thread is executing the critical section. If another thread comes a long, it will not be allowed to proceed until the flag is unset. This is called a <em>spin lock</em>, because any thread that tries to take the lock while it is, well, <em>locked</em>, will sit in a loop, waiting, wasting cpu cycles.<ul>
<li>This basic load/store does not work. One can imagine a situation where two threads take a lock at the same time because loading, setting then storing something in memory is not an atomic operation. This behavior is what professionals call "bad". </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Atomic variants of load/store: There are various hardware-implemented atomic variants of load and store that work (e.g. test and set, compare-and-swap, load-linked and store conditional, fetch-and-add).<ul>
<li>The different techniques under this umbrella vary in how they perform in terms of correctness (providing <em>mutual exclusion</em>), <em>fairness</em> (no thread will left behind, fetch-and-add for a ticket lock) and <em>performance</em> (is it fast and efficient).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these approaches handle the atomic aspect of implementing a lock. However, they still involve spin locking. That is, when a thread is unable to acquire a lock implemented by one of the above techniques, it will sit in a while loop. This is not efficient because you could have multiple threads get scheduled only to waste cpu cycles executing a while loop, while the thread with the critical section is waiting. Spin locking also means that there is no gurantee that a thread won't starve if scheduled and de-scheduled at just the right times (or wrong times, it depends on your perspective). Solving this requires some more additions to the locking code. Look up <em>park/unpark</em>, <em>linux futexes</em> and <em>two-phase locks</em> for examples of how the spin locking problem is solved.</p>
<h2 id="concurrent-data-structures">Concurrent data structures</h2><p>The next step after implementing basic locks is including them into common data structures. This allows these data structures to be <em>thread safe</em> ~ meaning they can be safely used when accessed by multiple threads.</p>
<p>As with many things in this course, there is a trade-off between simplicity and performance. Most of the time, the obvious implementation where you just lock the entire structure before accessing it does not scale well. So usually, we optimize the structure until it is "good enough". This is left undefined on purpose, because "good enough" depends on the context in which the data structure will be used. Sometimes, there is no need to add complexity for some slight increase in performance if the current performance works.</p>
<p>RANDOM TIP:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beware of control flow changes that lead to function returns. Because many function begin by acquiring a lock, allocating memory or some other type of initialization, when errors arise, the code has to undo all that state before returning, which is error prone.ditional, fetch-and-add).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="condition-variables">Condition variables</h2><p>In addition to synchronization via locks, threads will also need some sort of primitive to check if a condition is true before continuing execution. For example, a parent thread might wish to check if all its child threads have completed before moving on (a call to <em>join()</em> would need this).</p>
<p>The thing we are looking for is called a conditional variable. In its simplest form, a thread will check a condition, and if it is false, call <code>wait()</code> in order to be put to sleep until said condition changes. Another thread, responsible for making that condition true will at some point call <code>signal()</code> when the desired condition is met. This will wake up the waiting thread.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is every simple in the OS world. Race conditions will crop up if we just use <code>signal()</code> and <code>wait()</code> as described, conditional variables should always be used with locks. The rule of thumb is "always hold the lock when signaling".
If this wasn't the case, we could easily fall into situations when the a parent thread spins off a thread but is interrupted by the scheduler before calling <code>wait()</code>. The new thread will call <code>signal()</code>, and since nothing is waiting, will just continue on and eventually return. The first thread will continue, call <code>wait()</code> and wait forever. Sad.</p>
<p>Locks and conditional variables are a gateway drug to concurrency. Using these two primitives, we can create programs that (try to)  do useful work by using fine-grained synchronization between threads. One example of this is the <em>bounded buffer</em> or <em>producer/consumer</em> problem: A group of threads are designated as producers and another group as consumers. There is a shared buffer. The producers place data into this buffer as long as it is not full and the consumers read from the buffer whenever data is available.</p>
<p><em>Start tangent:</em></p>
<p>Getting such programs right in the C language (which is what the book uses) is quite annoying though. First, there is no easy way to test if the code is correct because the error conditions in these programs depend on the order in which threads run rather than on the code the threads are executing.  Second, finding these edge cases is a purely manual process; one needs to imagine up different scheduler behaviors and how that might affect thread execution. For non trivial programs, it is likely you will miss at least one such behavior. Thirdly, if you manage to figure out all the edge cases, your code will be a monster because of the sum of all the tweaks required to get things just right.
I think I am finally convinced that I need to look elsewhere than C for a language to learn for "low-level" stuff.</p>
<p><em>End tangent</em></p>
<h2 id="semaphores">Semaphores</h2><p>Semaphores are yet another synchronization construct. It is pretty similar to the conditional variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have two methods <code>wait()</code> and <code>post()</code></li>
<li>The semaphore wraps a counter of sorts and you set its initial value when you initialize the structure.</li>
<li>The call to <code>wait()</code> decrements the counter and moves on, unless the value is negative in which case it puts the thread to sleep.</li>
<li>The call to <code>post()</code> increments the counter and then if there is a thread to be woken, wakes them up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Good:<br>
Personally, i think semaphores are the most useful of the bunch. Partly because that is the only construct I have actually used. In my case, I found out you could use it very easily to throttle the number of threads concurrently issuing web requests to a server. Made my life very easy.</p>
<p>The OK:<br>
It might be tempting to want to say that semaphores are a generalization of locks and condition variables, but that kind of thinking is dangerous. Indeed, implementing condition variables with semaphores has proven to be extremely tricky and error prone to the point that it is usually never worth it if you can avoid it.</p>
<p>The Bad:<br>
Validating the correctness of an implementation that makes use of locks, condition variables, or semaphores is rough. Following along with the book I generally can find the obvious problem in the naive solutions pretty easily. Anything past that would require me spending a few hours, if not days looking at and thinking about the code. And even with that, you might still miss some. I just don't think it's worth it anymore. It does not seem responsible to build any critical systems in languages whose only solution to managing concurrency is these three constructs. Rust and Erlang are looking more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-bugs">Concurrency bugs</h2><p>This chapter is more of a summary of a <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/09fa-e6998/papers/concurrency-bugs.pdf">study on real-world concurrency bugs</a>.<br>
I read the paper, and it is mostly what you would expect. Most of these bugs happen because we cannot reason about concurrent programs in a fool-proof way. The paper classifies the bugs and their fixes into various categories (I would argue it does so arbitrarily, but what do I know? I don't have a Phd).<br>
No notes will be taken about this section because I'm lazy and have no real interest in remembering these categories. I <em>will</em> note that this paper only re-enforces my deep skepticism about sharing memory among threads. There has to be a better way.</p>
<h2 id="event-based-concurrency">Event based concurrency</h2><p>To finish up the section on concurrency, the authors introduced another alternative to using threads: the event loop. 
Using an event loop will supposedly sidestep all the headaches of thread synchronization by doing all the work on one thread. The thread in question will be in a continuous loop where it (a) listens for "events" then (b) calls the appropriate event handlers for said event. This is usually called the <em>event loop</em>.</p>
<p>So is this a viable alternative to thread-based concurrency? eh, I would not be so quick to jump aboard. The obvious downside is that an event handler cannot be a  long-running operation  because it will halt the world. So not the best choice for programs that spend a long time doing "stuff". However, it is a good fit for programs that can be written as "reactions" to outside events. A user-interface is one such example. It needs only do anything when the user initiates an action.</p>
<h1 id="persistence">Persistence</h1><h2 id="io-devices">IO devices</h2><p>A computer without a way to accept input will give the same results each time. A computer with no way to show output is even more useless. So clearly, input/output devices (or I/O devices) are important components to making computers useful to us.</p>
<p>These I/O devices are connected to the CPU via wires, or as people seem to call them, buses. Devices that require high performance are on faster buses, closer to the CPU. Lower performance components are further away and use slower buses. I believe performance here refers to transfer speed along the bus.<br>
We have a bus hierarchy for the same reason we have a memory hierarchy. Among other things, it is expensive to make fast components.<br>
It's was nice to learn that all those obscure names I have heard like eSATA, PCI and USB all refer to different types of buses.</p>
<p>Not unlike software, a hardware device will present an interface through which other components may communicate with it. This interface usually consists  of status, command and data registers. If the CPU were to interact with such a device, it would poll the status register till the device is ready, place some data in the data register then some command in the command register and finally poll again until the device finishes its work.</p>
<p>This way of interacting with i/o devices is simple, but has some inefficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polling: CPU polling for long i/o operations is wasteful. The thread that is polling is not doing other useful work. </li>
<li>Transferring data from memory to the device data register: Transferring data from memory to the I/O device registers takes some CPU cycles. Cycles that could be used for other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, these problems have simple solutions. The first problem is fixed by having the i/o devices send interrupts to the CPU whenever they are done with work. That way, the CPU does not have to wait around for them to finish. 
The second problem is solved using <em>Direct Memory Access</em>. This is a hardware component that lets the CPU give a specific I/O device direct access to a portion of memory. This frees up the CPU from copying data around. It can just let the I/O device read the data it needs directly from memory while it goes about doing more useful computations.</p>
<p>Two other things to note about I/O devices.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two ways of interacting with them, using explicit I/O instructions, or using <em>memory-mapped I/O</em>. Explicit io instructions  mean that the CPU has instructions for fetching data from and loading data to a given device register. Memory-mapped I/O means that the i/o device registers are simply treated like normal registers, so you can use normal <em>load</em> and <em>store</em> instructions to read data from and write data to them.</li>
<li>I/O device come in a variety of interfaces, even if they perform the same basic function. So how do we write OS code once and have it work for USBs, Hard Drives and SSDs? The answer is "Add Another Level Of Abstraction (TM)". This level of abstraction is <em>drivers</em>. I/O device drivers for a specific type of I/O device would expose the same interface to the OS, but take care of mapping that interface to whatever concrete device the driver is for. This is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because OS code beomes easier. A curse because this unified interface means we cannot be as efficient as we would like with certain devices. In some cases, we might not be able to take advantage of certain features a brand of hardware offers because it doesn't fit into the interface that the OS has for that type of device :/<br>
Choose wisely.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hard-disk-drives">Hard Disk Drives</h2><p>Yet another chapter that taught me things I did not know and explained words I previously did not understand.</p>
<p>I will attempt to summarize what I got out of the chapter in a series of bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard Drive Interface: An array of <em>sectors</em>. A sector is (usually) a block of 512-bytes that can be written to atomically. </li>
<li>Hard Drive "Geometry" (read, "what it's really like"): A stack of <em>platters</em>, each side of which is called a <em>surface</em>. A <em>spindle</em> spins the platters around at the advertised "RPM" (rotations-per-minute) of the drive. Data is encoded unto each surface in concentric circles called <em>tracks</em>. Each track is made of a series of sectors.  Data is written to a surface by inducing a magnetic charge. Data is read by sensing magnetic charges. The thing that does this inducing/sensing is called the <em>disk head</em> and it is attached to a <em>disk arm</em>. </li>
<li>To get to a certain sector, the disk head has to (a) <em>seek</em> the correct track then (b) wait for the <em>rotation</em> of the platter to bring the correct sector under the disk head and lastly (c) transfer the data. As you can imagine, doing this correctly while servicing multiple read/writes a second is no easy feat. So perhaps it is not so surprising to hear that hard drives have schedulers to uh, <em>schedule</em> the order in which i/o requests are handled by the disk head. </li>
<li>Everything else in the chapter is details that are nice to know exist, but i have no interest in actually knowing. A section about the various types of scheduling algorithms used, another about comparing two types of hard drives using I/O time as a metric, under two different workloads and yet another that had <em>integrals</em> (gasp). Excuse me, authors, but I didn't realize I was reading a calculus book. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hard drives are complex, and I'm glad they work. I'll leave figuring out the best way for them to work to people who make them for a living.</p>
<h2 id="raid">RAID</h2><p>RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. It is a hardware technique for getting speed, capacity and reliability out of a hard drive. This is one of the few times in computer science that we've been presented with three options then told we can have all three.<br>
One of the main reasons RAID caught on so quickly is "transparency". To the operating system, a RAID presents the same interface as a single hard drive.
Is RAID magic? No. It's "just" complex.<br>
RAID is basically a specialized computer system, a mini-computer of sorts that does exactly one thing.<br>
At a basic level, RAID is exactly that, an array of disks on which data is stored. How this data is stored on the disk array depends on what <em>RAID level</em> you are using.</p>
<p><strong>Before I go further, a tangent on workloads, metrics and measuring performance</strong><br>
As you know, metrics are what you measure things by. But figuring out how something performs against a metric depends on the given workload. Workload simulations are needed to test things against metrics.</p>
<p>Here the book offers two metrics: <em>single-request latency</em> and <em>steady-state throughput</em>. The authors also put forth simplifications of two types of workloads: <em>random i/o</em> and <em>sequential i/o</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Request Latency: How does the RAID perform when one request is issued against it? </li>
<li>Steady-State Throughput: How does the RAID perform when servicing multiple requests at a time? </li>
<li>Random I/O: The requests are for different, unrelated blocks.</li>
<li>Sequential I/O: The requests are for long contiguous blocks. </li>
</ul>
<p>So to evaluate the performance of a certain RAID level you need to calculate the two metrics for each of the two workloads.</p>
<p><em>That said, I'll simply outline the basics of the different RAID levels without commenting on how they perform. Look to the book for those details</em></p>
<p><em>RAID-0: Striping</em><br>
Consequent blocks are written across disks instead of on the same disk. So block 1 goes to disk 1, block 2 to disk 2, block 3 to disk 3, block 4 to disk 1 etc...
Technically, this is not RAID because it isn't redundant, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p><em>RAID-1: Mirroring</em><br>
Very similar to striping except the data is duplicated. So block 1 goes to disk 1 AND disk 2, block 2 goes to disk 3 AND 4 etc...
A mirrored system can tolerate 1 disk failure for certain, and up to N/2 disk failures depending on which disks fail (where N is the number of disks).
Speed wise, the waters get murkier. It depends on your workload.</p>
<p><em>RAID-4: Parity</em><br>
This is actually pretty cool. You stripe as usual without duplication (as in RAID-0), but add an additional disk called a <em>parity disk</em>. 
Each stripe maps to a parity block on the parity disk that contains the result of XORing all the blocks in that stripe. The result is that if you loose a disk, you can rebuild it by XORing the remaining blocks in a stripe with their corresponding parity block.</p>
<p><em>RAID-5: Rotating Parity</em><br>
An improvement over RAID-4 where the parity block rotates between disks instead of staying on one disk. It solves the performance bottleneck that occurs when writing data on RAID-4. In a RAID-4 system, with two requests to write, the parity disk becomes a bottleneck because both requests have to write to it.
Rotating the parity block avoids that a bit, making it more likely to have completely parallel writes.</p>
<h2 id="files-and-directories">Files and directories</h2><p>This was an "interlude" chapter for getting readers up to speed with the basics of UNIX files and directories. Since I already use Linux  as my personal computer, I already knew most of the material.<br>
I will make mention of <code>strace</code> here. The authors introduced it as a tool to figure out what system calls a program makes. What makes it wonderful is that it is remarkably easy to use.<br>

        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p class="measure-wide">
            My name is Eze and I am interested in computers and how they can be used. I currently specialize in Back End web development.
        </p>
        <h3>How I got here</h3>
        <p class="measure-wide">
            I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Gordon College in Wenham, MA.
        </p>
        <p class="mv2 measure-wide">
            During my third year in college, I rediscovered my passion for learning and directed it towards web development. I was then fortunate to be given the opportunity to work on my skills by developing web applications for my school. You can read more about the work I did from my resume and LinkedIn profile.
        </p>
        <p class="mv2 measure-wide">
            After I graduated, I was given the opportunity to be part of the first cohort for
            <a class="txt-link" href="https://hackdiversity.com/">Hack Diversity</a>; an organization committed to
            bringing more diversity into the innovation space. My experience with them gave me the chance to enter the tech scene in person.
        </p>
        <h3>Where I am going</h3>
        <p class="measure-wide">
            I want to be part of a close community of motivated individuals who share my passion for technology.
        </p>
        <p class="mv2 measure-wide">
            I want to be challenged to work in areas where I am not yet comfortable like network engineering, hardware and operating system internals. I also want to be continually challenged to improve in the areas I think I am good at.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be part of a team that is working hard on creating technology that empowers its users and makes them significantly better off.

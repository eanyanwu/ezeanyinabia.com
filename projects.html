                <p>
                    I started looking into Time Lock Encryption because I needed a way to lock my phone for a specific amount of time. After some research, I stumbled across <a class="txt-link" href="https://www.gwern.net/Self-decrypting%20files">this article</a>, which talks about the different approaches that can be used to simulate time lock encryption.
                    Working with the idea of serial hashing proposed in the article, I made what ended up being a python library of sorts that accepts some data as input and doesn't let you access the data until some time has passed i.e. puts it in a time box :)

                    For the curious, this website is served from a Digital Ocean droplet using nginx. I'm using a static page generator called Metalsmith to create the html pages. I'm irrationally wary of bootstrap, so for css I am using a fun library called Tachyons.

                <p>
                    Like most colleges, my school has a system for documenting room conditions before and after
                    students move in. Previously, the process was done using paper forms distributed to the residents.
                    During my third year, I came up with the idea to create an online alternative. The idea was
                    accepted as my senior project. I got two of my friends to create a team and we built the system.
                    We worked with the Housing Department to get it tested during the Spring semester of 2017.
                    They fully transitioned to using it during the 2017 Fall semester. I am currently maintaining it.

                    A New Student Portal for Gordon College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of a learning initiative, I partnered with two other computer science students to create
                    what would be the foundation of a new Student Portal for the school. The idea came from the Dean of
                    Students who served as our official client. After an intense eight weeks, we built a Minimum Viable Product. Throughout the next year, individual students worked on incrementally maintaining and upgrading the site. The next summer, a new group of 6 students built
                    on our work then publicly released the upgraded portal to the school.

                    A simple Twilio-powered bot for access to word definitions, weather, news, directions and search

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is probably the only pet project I’ve seen all the way through. It started because I used to
                    have a flip-phone. Every so often, when I would be reading a book I would need to look up a word,
                    but would not want to get up, power up my computer, open the browser and type in the word.
                    So I made an SMS bot to do all that <span class="i">hard</span> work for me.
                    Seeing how useful it was, I decided to add a few more features to it.
                    The highlight of the bot’s use was me helping a stranded stranger whose phone had died to find the
                    phone number for his roadside assistance provider.

title: The Disgruntled List

These are the areas where current software has fallen short in my view. Areas in which I am not satisfied with the status quo, but either don't have the time or skill to do anything about it at the moment. Identifying them and writing them down helps me get past them and move on with my life.

1. The browser rendering monopoly:  
Apart from Firefox, most major browsers are _basically_ using the same rendering engine: WebKit. I have nothing against webkit, but I feel that there might be more innovation and new ways of thinking if multiple equally-used browser engines existed. I'm glad that firefox is doing something in this field with their new Webrender engine, but I wish there were more players. Especially because the browser is more and more becoming our window into the world and the rendering engine playes a non-trivial part in this.

1. Unix-style package management:   
I didn't know unix-style package management had a problem until I started reading the [Nix package management paper](https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf). It opened my eyes to what could be. Unfortunately, my first impression is that Nix is over-engineered. And the only other project that is attempting to do the same thing, GNU Guix, is too idealistic with their Free Software/Hardware mantra. This leaves me feeling discontent with my setup, yet unable to do anything about it.

1. Alternative OS communities:
I moved away from Windows and Mac because I wanted an operating system that had a lower barrier to learning about its internals. I figured that if I used an operating system that was simpler, I would be more likely to delve into how it worked. This has proved to be true. I've tried a handful of Linux/BSD distributions and the consequence is that I discovered a joy for learning about how they work. However, the lack of diversity in this field has gotten to me. I did not think it would. But it really would be nice to be part of a community that is interested in systems programming and more low-level "boring" stuff. I am not pointing fingers at anyone, I just wish there were more _types_ of people in say the ArchLinux community or the OpenBSD community.

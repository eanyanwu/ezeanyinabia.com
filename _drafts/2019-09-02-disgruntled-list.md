title: The Disgruntled List

These are the areas where current software has fallen short in my view. Areas in which I am not satisfied with the status quo, but either don't have the time or skill to do anything about it. Identifying and writing them down apparently helps me move on with my life instead of wallowing in them for too long.

1. The browser rendering monopoly:  
Apart from Firefox, most major browsers are _basically_ using the same rendering engine: WebKit. I have nothing against webkit, but I feel that there might be more innovation and new ways of thinking if multiple equally-used browser engines existed. I'm glad that firefox is trying something different, but I wish there were more players. Especially because the browser is becoming our window into the world and the rendering engine playes a non-trivial part in this.

1. Unix-style package management:   
I didn't know unix-style package management had a problem until I started reading the [Nix package management paper](https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf). It opened my eyes to what could be. Unfortunately, my first impression is that Nix is over-engineered. And the only other project that is attempting to do the same thing, GNU Guix, is too idealistic in their stance on Free Software and Hardware. This left me feeling discontent with my setup, yet unable to do anything about it.

1. "UNIX" communities:
I moved away from Windows and Mac because I wanted an operating system that had a lower barrier to learning about its internals. I figured that if I used an operating system like GNU/Linux, I would be more likely to delve into how it worked. This has proved to be true as can be seen by my copious notes on operating systems. However, the lack of diversity in this field has gotten to me. I did not think it would. I am not pointing fingers at anyone, but I wish there were more _types_ of people in say the ArchLinux community or the OpenBSD communities.
